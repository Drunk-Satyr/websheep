          <p>
            Today I had a good day. I only had one meeting at work, where I only had to 
            speak for a moment. Besides that, I mostly answered some questions I was DMed
            and worked on two different tickets. I work on CD/CI pipelines and currently
            our team is in the midst of a migration where I play a large role as a dev,
            even though I only have a year of experience under my belt.
            <br><br>
            That has recently given me more confidence in myself, and my partner has found
            me even sexier with this newfound confidence. I'm trying to stop weighing my
            work as so important and try to start having hobbies again besides gaming. When
            I visited a friend in Salt Lake City, Utah last year, we played frisbee golf and
            I was hooked. But I ended up not playing again yet. I am going to buy myself a 
            set of frisbees and go out to this place about 30 minutes away, as it's the
            closest place.
            <br><br>
            If you're still reading this, I applaud you for suffering through my train of thought
            style of blogging, but maybe check back in in a few months and see an update. Maybe 
            I'll even include pictures.
            <br><br>
             P.S. I ended up ordering a set of six so I can play with my fiancee after writing
             all of this.
